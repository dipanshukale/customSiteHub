      story: `
  CraftiCrazy was never treated as “just a website”.
  It was treated as a growing business from day one.
  
  The system includes a full admin panel, payment integration, review handling logic,
  and operational flows that were tested repeatedly under real usage.
  
  Frontend development and product engineering were led by Vaibhavi Tingane,
  who translated complex business ideas into a refined, usable interface.
  Every component was built with clarity and long-term scalability in mind.
  
  Backend architecture, Docker-based deployment, business logic,
  and risk evaluation were handled by Dipanshu Kale.
  Every decision was made after evaluating pros, cons, and future growth paths.
  
  There were days where debugging alone lasted over 11 hours.
  Issues were not postponed.
  They were solved.
  
  Development spanned over two months,
  followed by two weeks of testing with real users and real feedback loops.
  
  This project reflects how we think about growth — not shortcuts.

      story: `
  This system was built for a newly launched restaurant
  that wanted to reduce dependency on staff for order handling.
  
  Each table was assigned a QR code.
  Customers scanned, ordered, and the kitchen received orders directly
  through the admin dashboard.
  
  Payment integration was intentionally excluded
  to support offline-first, fair transactions as requested by the client.
  
  This entire system was built solo by Dipanshu Kale during college days —
  from business understanding to UI, backend logic, and deployment.
  
  Over time, the same system was adapted and delivered
  to college students as academic projects,
  each version refined based on new requirements.
  
  This was the first foundational product of the agency
  and shaped how we approach real-world problems.

      story: `
  HomeMealHub was built to solve a deeply human problem —
  missing home-cooked food.
  
  The platform connects students and working professionals
  with nearby home cooks (mothers and aunties),
  allowing them to earn while providing fresh meals.
  
  This was a multi-role platform:
  customers, home cooks, and admins —
  each with distinct workflows and responsibilities.
  
  Frontend and admin interfaces were handled by Vaibhavi Tingane
  during her first large-scale product build,
  covering every user-facing detail.
  
  Backend systems, business logic, and scalability planning
  were led by Dipanshu Kale.
  
  Development lasted over five months.
  There were long days, skipped meals,
  and constant refinement based on real-life usage scenarios.
  
  This product was built with empathy,
  not assumptions.
