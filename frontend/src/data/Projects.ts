  CraftiCrazy was not just built to look good — it was engineered to survive real usage.
  From admin workflows to payment reliability, every decision was made with growth and stability in focus.
  
  This project was executed by a small, highly focused team.
  Frontend and product engineering were led by Vaibhavi Tingane, who translated business ideas into refined user experiences.
  Backend architecture, Dockerization, deployment strategy, and business logic were handled by Dipanshu Kale.
  
  There were days where debugging alone ran for 10–11 hours straight.
  Issues were not postponed — they were resolved.
  Client requirements were met, and in many cases exceeded, by anticipating future operational needs.
  
  The system includes a full admin panel, secure payment integration, review handling logic, and scalability considerations.
  Testing lasted over two weeks with real users, real devices, and real feedback — resulting in multiple refinements.
  
  CraftiCrazy was built with growth in mind, not shortcuts.

      desc: `
  This system was built for a newly launched restaurant that needed operational efficiency from day one.
  Each table was assigned a QR code allowing customers to place orders directly without staff intervention.
  
  The focus was reliability, clarity, and simplicity.
  Payment was intentionally excluded at the client’s request to support fair, offline-first transactions.
  
  This project was built end-to-end by Dipanshu Kale during early college days, without a team.
  Everything — from requirements gathering to UI, backend logic, and deployment — was handled independently.
  
  The system evolved over time.
  Multiple variations were delivered, including versions adapted for college projects.
  Real feedback shaped the final product.
  
  This was the first foundational project of the agency and remains a strong example of problem-first engineering.

  HomeMealHub addresses a deeply human problem — missing home-cooked food.
  The platform connects students and working professionals with nearby home cooks (mothers and aunties) preparing daily meals.
  
  This was a complex, multi-role system.
  Customers, home cooks, and admins all required separate interfaces and workflows.
  Subscription logic, meal scheduling, and earnings management added significant complexity.
  
  Frontend and admin UI were handled by Vaibhavi Tingane during her first large-scale project.
  Backend architecture, business logic, and scalability planning were led by Dipanshu Kale.
  
  Development stretched over five months.
  There were long days, skipped meals, and repeated refinements.
  The product was built with empathy, patience, and future growth in mind.
